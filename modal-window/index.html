      <h2>Trip to the mountains</h2>
      <p class="indent">Last winter I was lucky to be in the mountains. I can say right away that the impressions I received were indescribable. Now I really love mountains and I want to get to them without fail. When we went to the mountains and all the passengers had a view of the mountains from the window, everyone on the bus gasped. The mountain was very high and snowy. The moon illuminated her completely. Goose bumps ran through my body.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival, we checked into the hotel and the next day went on a hike, which changed my attitude towards the mountains. The walk was long. It snowed all day. The temperature was at least five degrees. There was a feeling that I was in a fairy tale.</p>
      <p>The group and I climbed higher and higher. There were tall spruces all around. Mountain streams ran. Everyone took a lot of photos. I also have a lot of photographs now.</p>
      <p>Climbing to the very top, you get the feeling that you are the lord of the mountains. The whole world is visible around you. Emotions overwhelmed me, I wanted to call my family and tell them that I was at the top. Unfortunately, there was no connection there. Therefore, I had to take all my emotions with me, preserving the warmest and most tender feelings of being in the mountains. Photos now remind me of my trip. And I'm looking forward to the next trek to the mountains, which I make you fall in love with them forever.</p>

      <h2>Travel by sea</h2>
      <p class="indent">What could be best in summer? Of course, only a summer spent at sea. The longest school holidays, hot sun and fresh fruits are much more pleasant to spend near the water. Moreover, the larger this reservoir and the cleaner the water in it, the better impressions will remain there.</p>
      <p>I love to sit on the beach and watch the waves crash against the shore. But most of all, I like to gaze into the horizon. Look at the border between water and sky. At such moments, I understand that the world is much more than the city in which I live. There are also beautiful sunsets on the sea. But this is already a topic for another composition.</p>
      <p>This summer we again went with the whole family to rest on the Black Sea, as every year we try to adhere to this tradition. I am looking forward to this magical time and am trying to thoroughly prepare for the next trip.</p>
      <p>This year we went to Sochi again, as we all really like this resort town. It has a very developed infrastructure for vacationers and tourists. But first, there was a long road ahead, which I love very much, since we got to the place by train. This is my favorite mode of transport, because during the journey there is an opportunity to think and dream. Sochi always welcomes its guests very hospitably.</p>

      <h2>City travel</h2>
      <p class="indent">On such trips you are going ahead of time! You prepare a route, choose places for stops, decide the issue of transport and accommodation, prepare a dictionary of the most necessary foreign words. In short, there is a lot of work! Sometimes you even get so tired that you want to drop everything and go at random. Yes, and so it happened :) But still, one fine day you get on a plane, leave your "ordinary life" somewhere behind the clouds and take off into a world unknown to you, where everything is different, although not always better. In general, you need to drive more often, it broadens your horizons well :)</p>
      <p>For the first time I found myself abroad quite late, at the age of 25. Late, you say? But this "late" saved my brain from destruction. After the first foreign trip, I struggled with depression for a week, during the second I wanted to escape, remain illegal, it was stupid not to go to the airport. For a long time I was tormented by the questions "How is that?", "Why do we have such a ..." and the like. But later I got used to it, calmed down and even began to find cons ("Haaa, but here we have ..."), you know. In general, traveling abroad has become easier, but no less interesting :)</p>
      <p class="fadeOut">You don't know how to please your beloved ("Well, how long can you go on these trips of yours! Let's go to Europe at least!"), Don't get bored yourself and spend the May holidays with benefit? Radials with a vertical set of +1000 meters per day and dinner on the shores of the legendary Lake Como, where the emperors of the Roman Empire built their villas. Here's an idea for you how to combine everything and protect your family from collapse!</p>
