Question: Why the decision on the large screen is better?
Answer: The decision for large screen is better, because: 
  - First: unobtrusive advertising;
  - Second: if we use mobile phone we force the user to perform unnecessary actions.
            On the large screen advertising is not bothering users;
  - Third: the user turns to advertising only if interested;
  - Fourth: if user use mobile phone, the advertisement obstructs the content, he does not understand where she/he is. 
           User disorientation.
  Generally modals interrupt the user experience and make it impossible to interact with the parent page. Content hidden behind the modal window.
