HW2.
Question: What is the difference between EM and REM ?
Answer:
    1. EM - calculated relative to the current font-size. If we change current font-size then the "em" currently changed. And the font-size is usually defined in the parent elements.
    
    2. REM (root em) - the "rem" unit is relative to the font-size of the <html> element. Or it is a typography unit equal to the root (base) font-size. This means what 1rem will always be equal to the font-size value that was defiitned in the html. Even if we change font-size in current properties rem would be give font-size from root (base, root) font-size. And it is the different between "em" and "rem".
